# Backlog Execution Order

> **Status is a point-in-time snapshot** (last refreshed 2026-06-14). The authoritative, live
> per-feature status is each feature's `requirements.md` front-matter, aggregated into
> [status.md](status.md) by `scripts/gen_status.py`. As of this refresh: **Waves 0–3 are `done`**;
> **Wave 4 (LuaRocks & Tooling) is next**. This doc's value is the *ordering and dependency edges*,
> which remain valid regardless of status drift.

A dependency-aware sequencing of every **executable** feature (status `planned` or
`in_progress`) so implementation agents can pull work in a safe, high-leverage order. This is
**not** a priority sort — ordering precedence is:

1. **Hard dependencies** (topological — an item is only *ready* when all its `Depends on` are done).
2. **Finish in-flight work** (partly-built features lead — low risk, they unblock consumers).
3. **Lead theme — Type-system intelligence** (chosen), then Navigation/Refactoring, then
   LuaRocks/Tooling, then Formatting/polish.
4. **Priority (MoSCoW / front-matter)** as the within-wave tie-break.

## How an agent uses this

- **Pick the lowest-numbered wave with a *ready* item** — ready = every `Depends on` entry is
  `done`. Within a wave, prefer higher priority.
- **Parallelism**: items marked **Parallel ✓** add new files / a distinct extension point and
  can run concurrently in separate worktrees. Items marked **Serial: <cluster>** mutate a shared
  hot file (the type engine, `LuaFormatBlock`, …) and must be done one at a time within that
  cluster.
- **Update `status` to `done`** in the feature's `requirements.md` as you finish; that makes its
  dependents *ready*. Re-run `scripts/gen_status.py`.
- Several "Wave 0/1" features are **already partly implemented** — read the design's "Current
  implementation status" note before starting; the remaining work is scoped there.

## Wave 0 — Finish the in-flight type engine  *(serial — shared `LuaTypeGraph`/`LuaTypesVisitor`/`LuaTypeManagerImpl`)*

These are partly built and unblock the entire lead theme. Do them first, in this order.

| ID | Title | Status | Prio | Depends on | Unblocks | Parallel |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TYPE-09-P0 | Union: De-risking spikes | done | H | — | TYPE-09-P2 | ✓ (throwaway spikes) |
| TYPE-09-P1 | Union: Infra & Flattening | done | H | — | TYPE-09-P3/P4 | Serial: type-engine |
| TYPE-09-P2 | Union: Compatibility (limits+memo) | done | H | TYPE-09-P0 | TYPE-09-P3/P4 | Serial: type-engine |
| TYPE-09-P3 | Union: Error reporting | done | H | TYPE-09-P2 | TYPE-09-P4 | Serial: type-engine |
| TYPE-09-P4 | Union: Verification & perf | done | H | P1, P2, P3 | — | Serial: type-engine |
| COMP-04 | Type-inferred completion (engine: self/`__index`) | done | H | — | SYNTAX-17, NAV-05/06 richness | Serial: type-engine, then ✓ (provider) |
| TYPE-02 | Class/Table defs (implicit fields) | done | H | — | NAV-05/06, COMP-04 richness | Serial: type-engine |

> The TYPE-09 phases are the sub-stories of the union epic; P0 (spikes) informs P2 (the limits),
> and P4 verifies P1–P3. COMP-04 and TYPE-02 cores already exist — only the named deltas remain.

## Wave 4 — LuaRocks & Tooling  *(two independent tracks — run A and B concurrently)*

Everything else is independent and can start as soon as its wave is reached.

## Parallelization guidance for multiple agents

- **Safe to run concurrently** (separate worktrees): any **Parallel ✓** items whose deps are
  done — e.g. the whole of Wave 1 can run in parallel once Wave 0 lands; ROCKS Track A and TOOL
  Track B are fully independent.
- **Keep one agent per "Serial" cluster** at a time: the **type engine** (Wave 0), and the
  **formatter** (FORMAT-03..06). Concurrent edits there will conflict.
- A reasonable 3-agent split once Wave 0 is done: Agent 1 = type-system (Wave 1), Agent 2 =
  navigation/refactoring (Waves 2–3), Agent 3 = ROCKS Track A. Tooling (Track B) and Formatting
  slot in as capacity frees.

## Maintenance

- This is a point-in-time plan (created 2026-06-13; status column refreshed 2026-06-14). When a
  feature reaches `done`, mark it in its `requirements.md`, re-run `scripts/gen_status.py`, and its
  dependents become ready. Treat the status column here as advisory — `status.md` is canonical.
- If cross-epic priorities change, re-order the waves; the **Depends on** column is the
  invariant that must always hold.
- See [planning-gaps.md](planning-gaps.md) for the original audit and
  [planning-handoff.md](planning-handoff.md) for the planning brief that produced these specs.
